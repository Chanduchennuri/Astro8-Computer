# Yabal

Yabal is a high level language which provides a simpler programming interface for the Astro-8 while still being optimized and as capable as Armstrong. [@GerardSmit](https://github.com/GerardSmit) is the sole developer and owner of Yabal, and this documentation is only hosted here due to it's relation to the Astro-8 computer.
