# Yabal

Yabal is a high level language which provides a simpler programming interface for the Astro-8 while still being optimized and as capable as Armstrong. [@GerardSmit](https://github.com/GerardSmit) is the sole developer and owner of Yabal, and this documentation is only hosted here due to it's relation to the Astro-8 computer.

## In order to use Yabal with the Astro8 emulator, follow these steps:

1. Move the Yabal compiler (`yabal.exe`) to the directory of your code, or [add it to your system PATH environment variable](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).
2. Compile your Yabal program. Use the command `yabal.exe build ./yourcode.yabal`. This will create a file called `yourcode.asm` in the same directory.
3. You can now run this assembly code using the Astro8 emulator like this: `astro8 ./yourcode.asm`
