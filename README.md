The Astro-8 is a 16-bit computer design. It has a working **[Logisim Evolution]** circuit, along with an emulator on Windows, Mac, and Linux, for running code at full speed. There is an assembly language, along with a higher level language called Armstrong, plus more which are actively being built by the community.

I created a video about the creation of this and how it works, which you can view here:

## Demos
There are some demos for the Astro-8, such as the pong game and a typing program. You can locate those in the folder `/example_armstrong_programs/`.

## Programming
The two most supported ways to program for the computer is using the [Astrisc instruction set](https://sam-astro.github.io/Astro8-Computer/docs/Architecture/Instruction%20Set.html) or [Armstrong](https://sam-astro.github.io/Astro8-Computer/docs/Programming/README.html). Those are both very low-level assembly languages, and may be difficult to learn. If you are looking for an alternative that's higher level, [Yabal](https://github.com/GerardSmit/Astro8) is an advanced and more modern language created by @GerardSmit.
