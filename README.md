The Astro-8 Computer is a 16-bit computer design. It has a working **[Logisim Evolution]** circuit, along with an emulator on Windows, Mac, and Linux, for running code at full speed. There is an assembly language, along with a higher level language called Armstrong, plus more which are actively being built by the community.

I created a video about the creation of this and how it works, [**which you can view here.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt0JfmV7CyI)

<br>

## Demos
There are some demos for the Astro-8, such as the pong game and a typing program. You can see more demos [**on the dedicated page**](https://sam-astro.github.io/Astro8-Computer/docs/Demos.html)

## Programming
There are a variety of ways to create programs for the Astro-8. [**You can see an overview here**](https://sam-astro.github.io/Astro8-Computer/docs/Programming/README.html)

{: .tip .caps}
The easiest starting point is [**Yabal**](https://sam-astro.github.io/Astro8-Computer/docs/Programming/README.html#yabal)! It is very similar to many other modern languages
